# Node Word Guess Constructor
## Chalk it up to Luck?

This was the ninth overall individual project for the University of Denver FullStack Coding Bootcamp.

This app uses Node JS to establish and work through a word guess in terminal. The full video that demo can be found here https://youtu.be/JPxICsqw0P0 

## Starting the app locally

For a local version, I recommend using Visual Studio Code. Navigate over to my GitHub repo, click clone, and be sure to type in the following below:
git clone
Navigate over to the terminal and open up the area around server.js in the terminal. Then type:
npm install
After all dependencies are loaded, then type:
node index.js

Finally, my repo can be found at:
https://github.com/justin1732/HW9ConstructorWordGuess

## Using this application

After you node into the index, make a guess in the terminal on what letter is in the word is being used. It will display if it is correct or incorrect, and will show you how many letters and guesses you have left. If you fail to guess correctly, it will show a "losing" message. If you guess correctly, it will show a "winning" message. Both options will give you the option to try again. 

## Technologies Used

This application primarily uses Node JS and CLI through the terminal to operate. To make it look a little better and add some color, I used figlet and chalk as dependencies.
